A digital signature is an electronic, encrypted, stamp of authentication on digital information1234. It is used to authenticate digital information such as form templates, forms, e-mail messages, and documents by using computer cryptography24. A digital signature confirms that the information originated from the signer and has not been altered1. Digital certificates are typically issued by a certificate authority (CA), which is a trusted third-party entity that issues digital certificates for use by other parties3.
